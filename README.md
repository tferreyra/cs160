# CS160 User Interface Design
Group project in my CS160: User Interfaces and Design course. We created Sleep Shift, an application that helps international travelers avoid jet lag. This application was made in Android Studio and is compatible with smart watches. This repo includes everything except the final code, which can be found in the Sleep Shift repo.
